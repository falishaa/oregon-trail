# oregon-trail
Simplified version of the original 1971 Oregon Trail video game. The player assumes the life of a 19th-century pioneer on the Oregon Trail. The player must hunt for food and ensure their health is kept intact during their journey. Additionally, the player must reach their destination of Oregon from New York City within one year. Otherwise, they run out of time and the game ends. Good luck!
